# Raichu
A utility Discord bot for the Nincord server.

Raichu is a simple bot that is currently being developed and expanded on. It utilizes Discord's new feature, slash commands, opposed to more traditional commands. Raichu is not made with any other server in mind besides Nincord, so in order for it to work otherwise, it might be necessary to make a number of changes to the code.

## Usage

* When the bot is invited to a server with the correct permissions, typing `/` in the message box will show a list of commands one can send.
* Each command has a different purpose, such as sending a message or playing music in a voice channel.
